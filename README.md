# SMS/Email Spam Detection with Streamlit UI 🚀
This repository showcases my SMS/Email Spam Detection Project, built with a powerful Naive Bayes Algorithm and featuring an intuitive Streamlit UI for real-time spam classification.

## Project Overview 🌟
The goal of this project was to build a robust machine learning pipeline for detecting spam messages in SMS and emails with high accuracy. The project also includes a user-friendly web application created with Streamlit for seamless interaction.

## Key Features 📋
#### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized patterns and distributions of characters, words, and sentences.
Uncovered key differences between spam and non-spam messages.
####🛠️ Text Preprocessing
Removed punctuation, stop words, and special characters for cleaner data.
Applied stemming to standardize words.
Used TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction to represent text numerically.
#### 🧠 Model Building
Implemented the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm.
Optimized the model for better spam detection.
#### 📊 Model Evaluation
###### Achieved:
    Accuracy: 97% ✅
    Precision: Perfect score = 1.0 🔥
    Validated results using a confusion matrix, precision-recall analysis, and other metrics.
#### 🌐 Streamlit UI
A clean and interactive user interface to test spam classification in real time.
Simply enter a message, and the app predicts whether it’s spam or not in seconds.
#### 🚀 Deployment
The Streamlit app is deployed on  Streamlit Community Cloud.
